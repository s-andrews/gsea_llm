# Test Datasets

We're going to collect a set of test datasets.  Each of these should represent two or three different biological themes.

Got to the GeneOntology or Amigo sites and find some themes.

For each theme find a set of gene ontology categories which describe it.

Collect the GO:xxxx IDs into a text file and submit it into a new folder here.

In each folder have 

* The text file of IDs
* A README.md which says what should be in there, biologically.
